<p>The projection model rests on the assumption that recent changes in the population density of enumerator areas will continue until some threshold level is reached. Once that density has been realised the population is fixed until the end of the projections period. There is obviously no certainty that past trends will continue indefinitely and the model should change when new information comes to light. One potential source of information is satellite telemetry showing how luminous areas are at night. At city level there is, internationally, a clear correlation between night time luminosity and the level of economic activity taking place. There is also a general correlation between the level of economic activity and the population of the city. Brighter cities clearly denote higher populations(at least in developed economies). Unfortunately, as an examination of South African cities shows, the correlation between population density and night time luminosity breaks down.</p>

<p>Statistically there is very little correlation between luminosity and population. With heavy traffic, more regular street lighting and wide-spread use of lit windows by shops business districts tend to be very well lit. These areas also tend to have small residential populations. Townships and suburbs, on the other hand, tend to be poorly lit (at least as seen from the air) yet contain higher densities of residents. These interactions result is a poor correlation between luminosity and population density.</p>

<p>The graphic below reflects the luminosity of Johannesburg at nigh in June 2016. Those familiar with the areas will be able to identify the main business districts and filaments indicating major arterial routes.</p>

<p>The absence of a clear correlation between population density and luminosity does not render the nightlights data irrelevant. Of particular value is the fact that changes in luminosity are informative of population density. In particular increased luminosity indicates rising economic activity and increasing population density.</p>

<p>Areas that 'brightened' significantly after 2011 were typically residential areas that had become more densely populated after 2011. These areas are illustrated by the yellow dots on the map below.</p>

<p>The above model examines the impact of bin size on the utility of the estimates. The explanatory value of the projections will also invariably decline as they reach ever further into the future. However knowing to what extent this occurs can only be known after the fact - possibly in 2022 or 2023.</p>

<p>The map below shows those areas where luminosity changed by more than 0.5 points between 2011 and 2016. Change in luminosity is measured on a scale of 0 to 2 with 2 indicating the most dramatic change in night time luminosity between June 2012 and June 2016. June values are used as this corresponds to winter - the time of year where, in Gauteng at least, the enumerator areas tree canopy in residential areas is at its seasonal minimum. Using winter values reduces the canopy differential between older suburbs and newer areas where trees are poorly established. Unfortunately nightlight values for June enumerator areas are not available prior to enumerator areas 2012 - hence the use of the 2012 values.</p>

<p>The change in luminosity is measured, technically, by the difference between the 2016 and 2012 z scores of the logarithm of observed values. A luminosity value of 2 corresponds to the 2016 value (logged) being two standard deviations more than the 2012 value (logged).</p>

<p>The system operates by the user first identifying how big a difference between the 2011 and 2016 values is called for before the projected value is over-ridden. This is a reflection of the preference the user has for using population estimates based on luminosity rather than the projections. The luminosity value of all the areas above the selected threshold are used to derive an estimate of population density using a simple formula. Most of the areas in which there has been marked increases in luminosity are new townships. By examining the nightlight and population values enumerator areas of a cross selection of townships a relationship between density and luminosity was derived. This formula was then used to estimate population figures for all areas falling above the selected threshold. Those new values were then used in lieu of the projected value.</p>

<p>The projections for 2016 may thus be 'enhanced' by identifying those areas which had significant increases in night time luminosity. Those luminosity value of those areas falling above the selected threshold were used to derive a new population estimate. As indicated the method is unproven and rests on confidence in the nightlight enumerator areas satellite telemetry.</p>

<p>The nightlight telemetry does not conform to administrative boundaries and is published at a fairly coarse resolution: squares of approximately 500m by 500m. These pixel are thus larger than many enumerator areas. Consequently it is necessary to provide the nightlights data as a grid with the coarser resolution.</p>

<p>Users are presented with current projections for 2016. They then decide at what level (the threshold) they want the population estimates to over-ride the projections. This is expressed as a number between 0.5 and 2 (with 2 indicating the biggest increase in luminosity enumerator areas over the period. The new values for each grid reference is then presented. The new population calculations are based on enumerator area values and are aggregated to grid level. For enumerator areas above the change threshold projections are based on the actual luminosity value and not the original projection. For enumerator areas enumerator areas below the enumerator areas threshold the original projections are used. These estimates are then re balanced to make sure they the total matches the projected city population.</p>

<p>The nightlights component is used to adjust measurements for 2016 (the latest year for which the telemetry is available). The intention is for the model to be updated each year after the June nighlights values become available. The new telemetry will the n be used to adjust that years projection based on the differences in luminosity between the last census and the most recent telemetry.</p>
