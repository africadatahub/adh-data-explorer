## React Setup

_Before starting, make sure the package.json file is in the templates/static/ directory._
Then do the following:
1. Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.10.1/node-v14.10.1-x64.msi) installed on your local machine or a higher version
2. [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) should be installed with node already, press the following to check if it has and what version
`npm -v`
3. Now install the react packages with `npm i` or `npm ci` (for clean install only)

4. To watch build files use `npm run watch` this will allow you to develop on the front end 
in real time while the local flask server is running on localhost:5000

5. To create production build use `npm run build`
