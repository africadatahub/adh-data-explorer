<p>The growth rate of metropoles has, in general, declined markedly since 1994. Between 1994 and 2001 the annual growth rate of metros was 3.4%. During the 2011-2016 period this had halved to 1.7% per annum. Although the rate of growth is declining the absolute increase in population is substantial - particularly in Gauteng. Thus while the cities are experiencing massive population growth the tempo at which that population is growing is abating. These changes are shown below.</p>

<p>There are significant differences in the growth rate of the larger cities and the two smaller metros (NMA and BUF). The smaller cities enumerator areas currently show increasing rates of growth while the larger metros show declining growth rates. In Tshwane and Johannesburg the growth rate is declining more slowly than in other cities. In Cape Town and Ekuruhleni the drop in the growth rate has been more marked. The growth rate of enumerator areas Ekuruhleni the growth rate is currently one-quarter what it was during the 1996-2001 period. In Cape Town and Ekuruhleni the drop in population growth has been so rapid that these cities may see population stagnation before 2030.</p>

<p>The trend to population stabilisation conforms to the evidence that the South African population is no longer growing "naturally" and will, within the next decade, enter a phase (but for immigration) of decline. Internal migration has a markedly different dynamic and there is remains significant scope for ongoing urbanisation for some time to come.</p>

<p>Identifying the equation that best fits the observed population for each city in 1996, 2001, 2011 and 2016 is a the centre of making projections. In each instance a substantial improvement on a linear projection is obtained by using a linear projection based on a "second order polynomial". These curves correspond to the form y=ax + bx2 +c where y is the population in the year for which a projection is to be made, 'x' is the population observed in the past and parameters 'a' and 'b' show how the curve changes over time. For each of the cities that curve that a) best fits the four observed points and b) projects that trend to 2030 is shown in the graphic below.</p>
