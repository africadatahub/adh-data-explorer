These are the steps to get the db setup

1. Download and install postgis locally http://download.osgeo.org/postgis/windows/pg96/

2. Setup the db on your local Postgres with the following commands:
cd C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.6
psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE scoda;
CREATE USER scoda;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE scoda TO scoda;
ALTER USER scoda WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'scoda';
psql -d scoda -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"
psql -U postgres -d scoda -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"
psql -U postgres -d scoda -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;"

3. From the app side download the additional data from the google drive and copy it to the data folder in the scoda project

4. After installing requirements and activating your local environment run "python rebuild_db.py"
